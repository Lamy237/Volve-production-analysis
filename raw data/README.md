## Introduction
This folder contains unprocessed production data from the Volve oil field in Norway. The data was released in the form of an excel file made up of two (02) sheets, 
namely **Daily Production Data** and **Monthly Production Data**.

As this project focuses on analyzing the **Monthly Production Data**, the sheet was changed into a `CSV` file.

**Important note:** In case you want to use this dataset for your own purpose, make sure to download the 
**[Equinor Open Data Licence](https://www.equinor.com/content/dam/statoil/documents/what-we-do/Equinor-HRS-Terms-and-conditions-for-licence-to-data-Volve.pdf)** 
to be aware of all the terms and conditions for using the Volve dataset.
